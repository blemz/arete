## [MemoryID: 20250810-MM06] Hybrid Memory System Implementation
**Type**: workflow_optimization  
**Priority**: 1  
**Tags**: memory-management, documentation, knowledge-persistence

### Workflow Description
Transition from monolithic CLAUDE.md memory files to hybrid memory architecture:
- **Root CLAUDE.md**: Recent critical decisions and active development context (last 30 days)
- **.memory/**: Organized long-term storage with categorization and indexing
- **Automated Maintenance**: Regular memory lifecycle management

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Migration Process**: Extract content from existing CLAUDE.md files into categorized memory files
2. **Storage Decision Logic**: Route memories to appropriate storage tier based on recency and priority
3. **Cross-References**: Maintain dependency links between related memories
4. **Index Management**: Catalog all memories with searchable metadata

### Storage Architecture

    └── 2025-08.md            # Time-based archive files
```

### Memory Categories and Priority Levels
- **Priority 1**: Critical decisions, active development context (Root CLAUDE.md + category files)
- **Priority 2**: Important implementation details (Category files only)
- **Priority 3**: Historical context (Archived after 90 days)

### Memory Lifecycle
1. **Creation**: New memories stored in appropriate category file
2. **Active Phase**: High-priority memories maintained in root CLAUDE.md
3. **Aging**: Memories migrate from root → category → archived based on age and usage
4. **Maintenance**: Weekly reviews for optimization and cleanup

### Agent Coordination Benefits
- **Context Injection**: Targeted context delivery based on agent specialization
- **Knowledge Persistence**: Decisions and learnings preserved across development cycles  
- **Reduced Token Usage**: Compressed memory delivery optimized for relevance
- **Scalable Growth**: Memory system scales with project complexity

## [MemoryID: 20250810-MM14] TDD Development Workflow
**Type**: workflow_optimization
**Priority**: 1
**Tags**: tdd, development-process, quality-assurance, testing

### Workflow Description  
Established Test-Driven Development process with strict quality gates:

#### Red-Green-Refactor Cycle
1. **RED Phase**
   - Write comprehensive failing test suite first
   - Define expected behavior and edge cases
   - Include both positive and negative test scenarios
   - Set up test fixtures and mock dependencies

2. **GREEN Phase**
   - Implement minimal code to pass all tests
   - Focus on functionality over optimization
   - Maintain test coverage above 90% threshold
   - Verify tests pass in isolation and as suite

3. **REFACTOR Phase**
   - Improve code quality, readability, and performance
   - Extract patterns and reduce duplication
   - Enhance documentation and type hints
   - Ensure all tests continue to pass

### Quality Gates
```python
# Required before any commit
pytest tests/ -v --cov=src/arete --cov-report=html --cov-fail-under=90
black src/ tests/ --check
flake8 src/ tests/
mypy src/
```

### Implementation Examples
```python
# Example: Document model TDD workflow

# 1. RED: Comprehensive test suite
def test_document_creation_with_valid_data():
    """Test successful document creation."""
    data = {
        "title": "Republic",
        "author": "Plato", 
        "content": "Justice is the excellence of the soul..."
    }
    document = Document(**data)
    assert document.title == "Republic"
    assert document.word_count > 0

def test_document_validation_errors():
    """Test validation catches invalid data."""
    with pytest.raises(ValidationError) as exc_info:
        Document(title="", author="Plato", content="Short")
    assert "title" in str(exc_info.value)

# 2. GREEN: Minimal implementation
class Document(BaseModel):
    title: str = Field(..., min_length=1)
    author: str = Field(..., min_length=1)
    content: str = Field(..., min_length=10)
    
    @property
    def word_count(self) -> int:
        return len(self.content.split())

# 3. REFACTOR: Enhanced implementation
class Document(AreteBaseModel):
    title: str = Field(..., min_length=1, max_length=500)
    author: str = Field(..., min_length=1, max_length=200)
    content: str = Field(..., min_length=10)
    language: str = Field(default="English")
    
    @field_validator("content")
    @classmethod
    def validate_content(cls, v: str) -> str:
        if len(v.strip()) < 10:
            raise ValueError("Content must be at least 10 characters")
        return v.strip()
    
    @property
    def word_count(self) -> int:
        """Calculate word count from content."""
        return len(self.content.split())
```

## [MemoryID: 20250810-MM16] Database Integration Workflow
**Type**: workflow_optimization
**Priority**: 2
**Tags**: database-integration, dual-persistence, consistency

### Workflow Description
Standardized workflow for integrating new models with dual database architecture (Neo4j + Weaviate):

#### Model Implementation Process
1. **Test-First Design**: Write comprehensive test suite following TDD pattern
2. **Base Model**: Inherit from AreteBaseModel with dual serialization
3. **Validation**: Implement domain-specific validation rules
4. **Serialization**: Add Neo4j and Weaviate format conversion methods
5. **Repository**: Create repository interface and implementation
6. **Integration Tests**: Validate dual database persistence

#### Dual Persistence Pattern
```python
class Document(AreteBaseModel):
    """Example of dual database model."""
    
    # Core fields
    title: str = Field(..., min_length=1, max_length=500)
    content: str = Field(..., min_length=10)
    
    # Neo4j serialization (graph relationships)
    def to_neo4j_dict(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        data = self.model_dump(exclude_none=True)
        data['id'] = str(data['id'])  # UUID to string
        return data
    
    # Weaviate serialization (vector embeddings)
    def to_weaviate_dict(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        data = self.model_dump(exclude={'id', 'embedding'})
        data['neo4j_id'] = str(self.id)  # Cross-reference
        return data
    
    # Vector content for embedding
    def get_vectorizable_text(self) -> str:
        return f"{self.title} {self.content}"

# Repository handles dual persistence
class DocumentRepository:
    async def create(self, document: Document) -> Document:
        # 1. Create in Neo4j (authoritative storage)
        neo4j_doc = await self.neo4j_ops.create_document(document)
        
        # 2. Create in Weaviate (semantic search)
        await self.weaviate_ops.create_document(document)
        
        return neo4j_doc
```

#### Consistency Maintenance
- **Cross-References**: Shared IDs maintain consistency across databases

pytest tests/ -v --cov=src/arete --cov-report=html --cov-fail-under=90
black src/ tests/ --check
flake8 src/ tests/
mypy src/
```

### Philosophical Content Testing Patterns

#### Expert Validation Testing
```python
@pytest.mark.philosophy
def test_aristotle_virtue_ethics_accuracy():
    """Test accuracy of Aristotelian virtue ethics responses."""
    query = "What is Aristotle's concept of eudaimonia?"
    response = rag_system.generate_response(query)
    
    # Content accuracy checks
    assert "flourishing" in response.answer.lower()
    assert "highest good" in response.answer.lower()
    assert any("Nicomachean Ethics" in c.source for c in response.citations)
    
    # Citation verification
    for citation in response.citations:
        assert citation.page_number is not None
        assert citation.book_reference is not None
```

#### Test Fixture Strategy for Philosophical Content
```python
@pytest.fixture
def sample_philosophical_text():
    """Canonical philosophical text for testing."""
    return """
    The unexamined life is not worth living. This famous declaration by Socrates
    at his trial represents a fundamental principle of philosophical inquiry.
    To examine one's life means to question assumptions, seek truth, and
    pursue wisdom through rational discourse.
    """

@pytest.fixture  
def republic_excerpt():
    """Plato's Republic excerpt with metadata for testing."""
    return {
        "title": "Republic",
        "author": "Plato", 
        "content": "Justice is the excellence of the soul...",
        "metadata": {
            "translator": "Benjamin Jowett",
            "stephanus_page": "353e", 
            "book": "I"
        }
    }
```

### Database Testing Patterns

#### Neo4j Integration Testing
```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def neo4j_test_session():
    """Clean Neo4j test session with automatic cleanup."""
    driver = GraphDatabase.driver("bolt://localhost:7687", auth=("test", "test"))
    
    with driver.session() as session:
        session.run("MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n")  # Clean slate
        yield session
        
    driver.close()  # Resource cleanup

def test_document_creation_in_neo4j(neo4j_test_session, sample_document):
    """Test document persistence in graph database."""
    client = Neo4jClient(neo4j_test_session)
    result = client.create_document(sample_document)
    
    assert result.id is not None
    assert result.title == sample_document.title
```

#### Weaviate Vector Testing
```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="session") 
def weaviate_test_client():
    """Clean Weaviate test client with schema setup."""
    client = weaviate.Client("http://localhost:8080")
    client.schema.delete_all()  # Clean test environment
    
    # Setup test schema
    client.schema.create_class({
        "class": "TestDocument",
        "properties": [
            {"name": "title", "dataType": ["text"]},
            {"name": "content", "dataType": ["text"]}
        ]
    })
    
    yield client
    client.schema.delete_all()  # Cleanup

def test_document_embedding_storage(weaviate_test_client, sample_document):
    """Test vector embedding storage and retrieval."""
    client = WeaviateClient(weaviate_test_client)
    result = client.store_document(sample_document)
    
    assert result.vector is not None
    assert len(result.vector) == 768  # Expected embedding dimensions
```

### Performance and Load Testing
```python
@pytest.mark.slow
def test_concurrent_query_performance():
    """Test system performance under concurrent load."""
    def single_query():
        return query_service.ask("What is virtue?")
    
    start_time = time.time()
    
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(single_query) for _ in range(50)]
        results = [f.result() for f in futures]
    
    elapsed = time.time() - start_time
    
    # Performance assertions
    assert elapsed < 30  # Complete within 30 seconds
    assert all(r.answer for r in results)  # All queries succeed
    assert len(set(r.answer for r in results)) > 1  # Response variety
```

### Validation and Error Testing
```python
def test_document_validation_comprehensive():
    """Test comprehensive document validation edge cases."""
    # Test empty title
    with pytest.raises(ValidationError) as exc_info:
        Document(title="", author="Plato", content="Valid content")
    assert "min_length" in str(exc_info.value)
    
    # Test content too short  
    with pytest.raises(ValidationError):
        Document(title="Title", author="Author", content="Short")
    
    # Test invalid language format
    with pytest.raises(ValidationError):
        Document(title="Title", author="Author", content="Content", language="123")
```
