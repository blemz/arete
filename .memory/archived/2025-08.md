# Archived Memories - August 2025

This file contains archived memories that are older than 90 days or have been superseded by newer implementations. These memories are preserved for historical reference and learning.

## Archive Organization

Memories are archived when they meet any of these criteria:
- Age > 90 days and not frequently accessed
- Superseded by newer implementations
- Historical decisions no longer relevant to current architecture
- Completed implementations that don't require active reference

## Archived Entries

*No entries archived yet - project is in initial development phase.*

## Archival Process

### Automated Archival Triggers
- **Age-based**: Memories older than 90 days automatically reviewed for archival
- **Usage-based**: Memories not accessed in 60 days flagged for review
- **Supersession**: When new memories explicitly supersede older ones

### Manual Archival Process
1. **Review**: Evaluate memory for continued relevance
2. **Dependencies**: Check if other active memories depend on this one
3. **Compression**: Summarize key insights if archiving detailed implementation
4. **Cross-reference Update**: Update index.md to reflect archival
5. **Notification**: Inform relevant agents of archival if needed

### Archival Categories
- **Superseded Decisions**: Architecture decisions replaced by newer choices
- **Completed Implementations**: Implementation details no longer needed for active development
- **Historical Context**: Background information valuable for historical reference
- **Deprecated Patterns**: Coding patterns no longer recommended

## Retrieval Process

Archived memories can be retrieved when needed:
- **Historical Analysis**: Understanding evolution of decisions
- **Similar Problem Solving**: Learning from past approaches to similar issues
- **Onboarding**: New team members understanding project history
- **Audit Requirements**: Compliance or documentation requirements

### Search Capabilities
- **Full-text Search**: Search archived content for specific terms or concepts
- **Category Filtering**: Filter by archive category (decisions, implementations, patterns)
- **Date Range**: Find memories from specific time periods
- **Dependency Tracking**: Locate related archived memories
