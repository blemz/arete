## SOCRATIC EXAMINATION

### ยง1. ON VIRTUE

**Socrates:** "What is virtue, Meno? Can you tell me?"

**Meno:** "There are many virtues, Socrates - the virtue of a man, of a woman, of a child, of an old person."

**Socrates:** "But I am looking for one virtue that is common to all these. What makes them all virtues?"

#### 1.1. The Unity of Virtue
- **Universal Definition**: All virtues must share something in common
- **Essence vs Examples**: Seeking the form rather than instances
- **Methodological Approach**: Using definition to understand particulars

### ยง2. ON KNOWLEDGE

**Socrates:** "The unexamined life is not worth living."

#### 2.1. Self-Knowledge
- **Philosophical Priority**: Know thyself before all else
- **Wisdom Recognition**: True wisdom is knowing what you don't know
- **Educational Process**: Learning through questioning and dialogue
