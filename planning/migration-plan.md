# Arete UI Migration Plan: Streamlit → Reflex + DaisyUI + Tailwind

## Project Overview
Migration of Arete's philosophical tutoring system from Streamlit to a modern web UI using Reflex (Python full-stack), DaisyUI (component library), and Tailwind CSS (styling framework).

## Current State Analysis

### Streamlit Implementation Status
- **Production Ready**: Fully functional chat interface with RAG pipeline
- **Advanced Features**: Split-view layout, document viewer, citation highlighting, graph analytics
- **Recent Stabilization**: Phase 6.3 resolved critical CSS, import, and session state issues
- **Testing**: 34/34 tests passing for document viewer components

### Limitations Addressed by Migration
- **Template Rigidity**: Limited customization and layout flexibility
- **Performance Issues**: Re-runs entire application on every interaction
- **UI Constraints**: Restricted component library for complex interfaces
- **Scalability**: Not ideal for long-running, highly interactive applications

## Technology Stack

### New Architecture
- **Frontend Framework**: Reflex (Python full-stack, transpiles to FastAPI + React)
- **Component Library**: DaisyUI (semantic component classes)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (utility-first CSS framework)
- **Theme**: Academic/professional DaisyUI theme
- **Backend**: FastAPI (generated by Reflex)

### Key Advantages
- **Pure Python**: No JavaScript knowledge required
- **Professional UI**: DaisyUI pre-built themes and components
- **Performance**: No re-execution bottlenecks
- **Modern Web Standards**: Better responsive design and accessibility
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner component architecture

   - Cross-browser compatibility
   - Accessibility compliance validation
   - Performance benchmarking

## Migration Strategy

### Parallel Development Approach
- **Coexistence**: Keep Streamlit running during migration
- **Incremental**: Migrate features component by component
- **Validation**: Test each component before proceeding
- **Rollback**: Maintain Streamlit as fallback during development

### Feature Parity Requirements
