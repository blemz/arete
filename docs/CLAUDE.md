## Documentation Standards & Conventions

### Writing Style
- **Clear and Concise**: Technical accuracy without unnecessary complexity
- **Audience-Aware**: Tailored to specific reader needs (developer vs. end-user)
- **Example-Rich**: Code samples and concrete examples for all concepts
- **Update-Friendly**: Structured for easy maintenance and updates

### Markdown Standards
```markdown
# Main Title (H1) - One per document
## Section Headers (H2) - Major sections  
### Subsections (H3) - Detailed topics
#### Minor Subsections (H4) - Specific details

**Bold** for emphasis and key terms
*Italic* for filenames and technical terms
`Code` for inline code and commands
```

### Code Documentation Pattern
```markdown
### Configuration Example
```python
# Always include imports
from arete.config import get_settings

# Provide working examples
settings = get_settings()
print(f"Neo4j URI: {settings.neo4j_uri}")
```

**Key Points:**
- Import statements show required dependencies
- Examples demonstrate actual usage patterns
- Comments explain non-obvious behavior
```

### Documentation Linking
```markdown
# Internal links (relative paths)
See [Development Progress](development_progress.md) for details.
See [Configuration Guide](../config/CLAUDE.md) for setup.

# External links (absolute URLs)  
Check the [Neo4j Documentation](https://neo4j.com/docs/) for more information.

# Anchor links within document
Jump to [Database Setup](#database-setup) section below.
```

  "context": "Nicomachean Ethics",
  "max_citations": 5
}
```

**Response:**

### User Guide Documentation (PLANNED) 
**Target Completion**: Week 12 (after UI completion)

#### asking_questions.md
```markdown
# How to Ask Effective Philosophical Questions

## Question Types

### **Conceptual Questions**
- "What is Kant's categorical imperative?"
- "How does Plato define justice?"

### **Comparative Questions**  
- "How do Aristotle and Kant differ on virtue ethics?"
- "What is the relationship between Stoicism and Buddhism?"

### **Historical Questions**
- "How did ancient Greek philosophy influence medieval thought?"
- "What led to the decline of scholasticism?"

## Getting Better Responses

### **Be Specific**
- ❌ "Tell me about ethics"
- ✅ "What are the main components of Aristotle's virtue ethics theory?"

### **Provide Context**
- "In the context of Plato's Republic, how is justice defined?"
- "According to Kant's Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals..."

### **Ask for Examples**
- "Can you provide examples of Stoic practices for developing virtue?"
- "What are some applications of utilitarian thinking in modern ethics?"
```

### Developer Guide (PLANNED)
**Target Completion**: Week 5 (after core development)

#### testing_guide.md
```markdown
# Testing Guide for Arete Developers

## Test-Driven Development Process

### 1. Red Phase: Write Failing Test
```python
def test_entity_extraction_from_text():
    """Test extracting philosophical entities from text."""
    text = "Socrates taught that virtue is knowledge."
    extractor = EntityExtractor()
    
    entities = extractor.extract(text)
    
    assert len(entities) >= 2
    assert any(e.name == "Socrates" and e.type == "Person" for e in entities)
    assert any(e.name == "virtue" and e.type == "Concept" for e in entities)
```

### 2. Green Phase: Minimal Implementation
```python
class EntityExtractor:
    def extract(self, text: str) -> List[Entity]:
        # Minimal implementation to pass test
        entities = []
        if "Socrates" in text:
            entities.append(Entity(name="Socrates", type="Person"))
        if "virtue" in text:
            entities.append(Entity(name="virtue", type="Concept"))
        return entities
```

### 3. Refactor Phase: Robust Implementation
```python
class EntityExtractor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
        self.philosophy_terms = load_philosophy_vocabulary()
    
    def extract(self, text: str) -> List[Entity]:
        doc = self.nlp(text)
        entities = []
        
        for ent in doc.ents:
            if ent.label_ == "PERSON":
                entities.append(Entity(name=ent.text, type="Person"))
            elif ent.text.lower() in self.philosophy_terms:
                entities.append(Entity(name=ent.text, type="Concept"))
        
        return entities
```
```
