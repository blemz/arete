# Memory System Migration Complete

Neo4j graph operations, client patterns, and query strategies have been migrated to the hybrid memory system.

## Graph Information Now Located At:

- **Neo4j Schema Design**: `../../../.memory/architecture/decisions.md` → [MemoryID: 20250810-MM07]
- **Database Client Patterns**: `../../../.memory/architecture/patterns.md` → [MemoryID: 20250810-MM11]
- **Connection Management**: `../../../.memory/development/bugs.md` → [MemoryID: 20250810-MM20]
- **Query Builder Patterns**: `../../../.memory/architecture/patterns.md` → [MemoryID: 20250810-MM12]

## Implementation Status:
- Neo4j schema ✅ COMPLETED - Constraints, indexes, and full-text search
- Connection client ⏳ NEXT - Connection pooling and health monitoring  
- CRUD operations ⏳ PENDING - Document and entity operations
- Query builder ⏳ PENDING - Fluent API for complex queries
