# Memory System Migration Complete

RAG system architecture and LLM integration patterns have been migrated to the hybrid memory system.

## RAG Information Now Located At:

- **Multi-Provider LLM**: `../../../.memory/architecture/decisions.md` → [MemoryID: 20250810-MM01]
- **Weaviate Vector Config**: `../../../.memory/architecture/decisions.md` → [MemoryID: 20250810-MM08]
- **LLM Provider Issues**: `../../../.memory/development/bugs.md` → [MemoryID: 20250810-MM22]

## Implementation Status:
- Hybrid database strategy ✅ DESIGNED - Neo4j + Weaviate + Redis
- Multi-provider LLM ✅ CONFIGURED - Ollama, OpenRouter, Gemini, Anthropic
- RAG pipeline ⏳ PENDING - Hybrid retrieval implementation
- Response generation ⏳ PENDING - LLM integration with failover
