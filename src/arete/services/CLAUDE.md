# Memory System Migration Complete

Service layer architecture and business logic patterns have been migrated to the hybrid memory system.

## Service Information Now Located At:

- **Repository Patterns**: `../../../.memory/architecture/decisions.md` → [MemoryID: 20250810-MM05]
- **Error Handling Patterns**: `../../../.memory/architecture/patterns.md` → [MemoryID: 20250810-MM13]
- **Performance Optimization**: `../../../.memory/development/learnings.md` → [MemoryID: 20250810-MM09]

## Implementation Status:
- Repository pattern ✅ DESIGNED - Clean architecture with dependency injection
- Service interfaces ⏳ PENDING - Document, query, and validation services
- Business logic ⏳ PENDING - Domain service implementations
- Event handling ⏳ PENDING - Service coordination patterns
