# Memory System Migration Complete

This file has been migrated to the new hybrid memory architecture.

## New Memory Locations:

- **Root Context**: `../../CLAUDE.md` - Recent critical decisions and active development context
- **Architecture Decisions**: `../../.memory/architecture/decisions.md`
- **Coding Patterns**: `../../.memory/architecture/patterns.md`
- **Development Workflows**: `../../.memory/development/workflows.md`
- **Development Learnings**: `../../.memory/development/learnings.md`
- **Bug Patterns**: `../../.memory/development/bugs.md`
- **Memory Index**: `../../.memory/index.md` - Complete catalog with cross-references

## Benefits of New System:
- **Scalable**: Organized categorization prevents information overload
- **Searchable**: MemoryID system enables precise memory retrieval
- **Optimized**: Context delivery tailored for different agent specializations
- **Maintainable**: Automated lifecycle management with archival system
