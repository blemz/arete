# Memory System Migration Complete

Data processing pipeline architecture and patterns have been migrated to the hybrid memory system.

## Pipeline Information Now Located At:

- **Memory Management**: `../../../.memory/development/bugs.md` → [MemoryID: 20250810-MM23]
- **Performance Patterns**: `../../../.memory/development/learnings.md` → [MemoryID: 20250810-MM09]
- **Database Integration**: `../../../.memory/development/workflows.md` → [MemoryID: 20250810-MM16]

## Implementation Status:
- Text processing strategy ✅ DESIGNED - Streaming and batch processing patterns
- Entity extraction ⏳ PENDING - NLP pipeline with philosophical entity recognition
- Knowledge graph construction ⏳ PENDING - Graph building from processed documents
- Pipeline orchestration ⏳ PENDING - Workflow coordination and monitoring
