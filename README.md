# Arete: AI Philosophy Tutor with Graph-RAG

> *"Excellence is never an accident. It is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, and intelligent execution"* - Aristotle

Arete is an advanced AI tutoring system specifically designed for classical philosophical texts, using a novel Graph-RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture to provide accurate, well-cited, and educationally valuable responses to philosophical questions.

## 🎯 Project Vision

Arete aims to democratize access to high-quality philosophical education by:
- Providing accurate, citation-backed answers to philosophical questions
- Making classical texts more accessible to modern students
- Supporting educators with AI-powered teaching assistance
- Preserving the nuance and complexity of philosophical discourse

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Docker Desktop 4.0+
- 8GB RAM (minimum) - Cloud embedding services reduce memory requirements
- Cloud API Keys (recommended for best performance) - OpenAI, OpenRouter, or Gemini

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arete-ai/arete.git
cd arete
```

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev,all]"
```

3. **Configure cloud providers (recommended):**
```bash
# Add to .env file for optimal performance
echo "EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai" >> .env
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key" >> .env
echo "SELECTED_LLM_PROVIDER=openai" >> .env
echo "SELECTED_LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini" >> .env

# Alternative: Use OpenRouter for cost-effective access
# echo "EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openrouter" >> .env
# echo "OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key" >> .env
```

4. **Start the services:**
```bash
# Start database services
docker-compose up -d neo4j weaviate

# Wait for services to be healthy
docker-compose ps
```

5. **Test the RAG system immediately:**
```bash
# Enhanced RAG CLI with real philosophical content
python chat_rag_clean.py "What is virtue?"
python chat_rag_clean.py "What is Socrates being accused of in the Apology?"

# Interactive philosophical conversations
python chat_rag_clean.py
```

6. **Launch full application:**
```bash
# Web interface with advanced features
streamlit run src/arete/ui/streamlit_app.py
```

7. **Access the system:**
- **RAG CLI**: `python chat_rag_clean.py` (Ready immediately!)
- Web Interface: http://localhost:8501
- Neo4j Browser: http://localhost:7474
- Weaviate: http://localhost:8080

### Development Setup

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Run tests
pytest tests/ -v --cov=src/arete

# Run linting
black src/ tests/
flake8 src/ tests/
mypy src/

# Generate documentation
sphinx-build -b html docs/ docs/_build/
```

## 📚 Usage Examples

### Ready-to-Use RAG CLI

```bash
# Ask complex philosophical questions with real citations
python chat_rag_clean.py "What is virtue?"
python chat_rag_clean.py "What is Socrates being accused of in the Apology?"
python chat_rag_clean.py "How does Charmides define temperance?"

# Interactive philosophical discussions
python chat_rag_clean.py
# Then ask: "What is the relationship between knowledge and self-knowledge?"
```

### Programmatic API Usage

```python
from arete import AreteClient

client = AreteClient()

# Ask a philosophical question (automatically selects optimal LLM provider)
response = client.ask("What is Aristotle's view on virtue ethics?")
print(response.answer)
print(response.citations)
print(f"Answered by: {response.provider}")
```

### Advanced Query with Context

```python
# Query with specific context and provider preference
response = client.ask(
    question="How does Plato's theory of Forms relate to modern epistemology?",
    context="Plato's Republic, Books VI-VII",
    max_citations=5,
    preferred_provider="anthropic"  # Optional: specify provider
)

# Get detailed explanations
for citation in response.citations:
    print(f"{citation.text} - {citation.source} ({citation.location})")
```

### Document Processing

```python
from arete.processing import DocumentProcessor

processor = DocumentProcessor()

# Process a new philosophical text
result = processor.process_document(
    file_path="data/plato_republic.pdf",
    metadata={"author": "Plato", "title": "Republic", "language": "English"}
)

print(f"Processed {result.chunks} chunks, extracted {result.entities} entities")
```
