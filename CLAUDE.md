## System Architecture (Completed)

### Core Infrastructure âœ…
- **Phase 1**: Foundation complete (Database clients, models, configuration)
- **Phase 2**: Text processing complete (Chunking, PDF extraction, embeddings, citations)
- **Phase 3**: Retrieval systems complete (Sparse BM25/SPLADE, dense vectors, re-ranking)
- **Phase 4**: LLM integration complete (Multi-provider support, prompt engineering)
- **Phase 5**: User interface complete (Chat, document viewer, accessibility)
- **Phase 6.2**: Advanced analytics complete (Centrality analysis, community detection, influence networks, historical development)
- **Phase 6.3**: UI stabilization complete (Bug fixes, CSS rendering, import resolution, accessibility improvements)

- **Repository Pattern**: Clean data access separation across all components

## Next Priority: Content Expansion and System Enhancement

### Classical Text Corpus Expansion - IMMEDIATE NEXT PHASE
1. **Additional Text Ingestion**
   - Complete Plato's dialogues (Republic, Meno, Phaedo, Symposium)
   - Aristotle's works (Nicomachean Ethics, Politics, Metaphysics)
   - Process remaining AI-restructured texts through pipeline
   - Build comprehensive philosophical knowledge graph

2. **Graph Analytics Dashboard Integration**
   - Integrate advanced analytics dashboard with main Streamlit interface
   - Real-time centrality analysis for knowledge graph insights
   - Historical development visualization for philosophical concept evolution
   - Interactive network exploration for entity relationships

3. **System Optimization**

## Core Development Principles

- **Test-Driven Development**: Strict Red-Green-Refactor cycle, >90% coverage
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Contract-based testing, focus on essential functionality
- **Don't Simplify to Pass**: *Never* simplify, hard-code, or patch tests to make them pass; fix the underlying code so the real-world behavior is correct.
- **Educational Focus**: Pedagogical value prioritized, all responses citation-backed
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type hints and Pydantic validation
- **Performance**: Connection pooling, caching, batch processing optimization

## Development Routines

- **start-day**: Read project context (CLAUDE.md, README.md, planning/, .memory/) and summarize current status
- **end-day**: Update project documentation and commit changes
