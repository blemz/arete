# Arete Project - Active Context

## Project Overview

**Arete** is a Graph-RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) AI tutoring system for classical philosophical texts. Combines Neo4j knowledge graphs, Weaviate vector embeddings, and multi-provider LLM support for accurate, well-cited philosophical education.

## Test Driven Development (TDD)

- **Definition**: TDD is an iterative software development methodology where you always write failing unit tests before writing the actual functional code. *Always use it.*
- **Red–Green–Refactor Cycle**:
  1. **Red**: Define a unit test for a specific function or feature that does not yet exist. The test must fail because the supporting code is missing.
  2. **Green**: Write the minimum code required to make the failing test pass. At this stage, focus solely on correctness, not polish.
  3. **Refactor**: Once the test passes, improve the code’s structure, readability, and maintainability, ensuring all existing tests remain green.
- **Clarity of Purpose**: The end goal is always clear, maintainable, and idiomatic code that is production-ready. *Always keep this principle in mind.*
- **No Test Compromise**: Never weaken or simplify a test just to make it pass; doing so harms correctness and usability.
- **Test Quality**: Prioritize writing tests that are meaningful, relevant, and aligned with the feature’s actual use cases.
- **Feature Policy**: Every new feature must include both the implementation and its tests, committed together.
- **Lifecycle Discipline**: Apply the TDD process consistently for all changes (new features, bug fixes, refactors) across the entire project lifecycle.

**Last Updated**: 2025-09-08  
**Current Phase**: 8.1 Complete - Critical RAG Integration + Phase 8.2 UI Enhancement IN PROGRESS  
**Next Phase**: Complete UI Enhancement Implementation  
**System Status**: **🚀 MODERN WEB INTERFACE OPERATIONAL** - Complete philosophical tutoring system with modern Reflex web interface, but UI enhancements in progress
**Launch Options**: 
- **NEW Modern Web Interface**: `cd src/arete/ui/reflex_app && reflex run` (Production Reflex app)
- **Enhanced RAG CLI**: `python chat_rag_clean.py "What is virtue?"` (Production RAG system)
- Legacy CLI: `python chat_fast.py "What is virtue?"` (Mock responses)

## Phase 8.2: UI Enhancement Implementation Status [IN PROGRESS]

### Issue Identified
The Reflex web interface lacks the expected UI enhancements:
1. **Missing Thinking Indicator**: No "🏛️ Arete is thinking..." with animated dots during processing
2. **Poor Response Formatting**: Responses appear as plain text without proper sections, headers, and structure

### Technical Analysis
- **Root Cause**: Multiple state management systems in the Reflex app
- **Modified Components**: Updated newer chat components (components/chat.py, state/chat_state.py) 
- **Active System**: App currently uses older arete.py state system (arete/arete.py)
- **State Conflict**: Changes to ChatState not being utilized by main app interface

### Work Completed ✅
1. **Enhanced chat components**: Modified message_bubble to use markdown rendering
2. **Added thinking indicator**: Implemented animated dots component in chat_messages
3. **Improved state management**: Added structured response formatting in ChatState.send_message
4. **Response parsing integration**: Connected ResponseParser for better content structure

### Work Required 🔧
1. **State System Integration**: Connect enhanced ChatState to main arete.py interface
2. **Component Migration**: Ensure app uses updated chat components instead of legacy ones
3. **Testing**: Verify thinking indicator and formatting work in live interface
4. **Optimization**: Remove duplicate state management systems

### Expected Outcome
- "🏛️ Arete is thinking..." with animated dots during RAG processing
- Structured responses with sections like:
  - "🏛️ Arete Response"
  - "Summary of the accusations (plain language)"
  - "Key terms explained simply" 
  - "Citations"

### Next Session Continuation Point
**File**: `src/arete/ui/reflex_app/arete/arete.py` (lines 244-300)
**Task**: Update main app to use enhanced ChatState and components
**Priority**: HIGH - Critical for user experience improvement
