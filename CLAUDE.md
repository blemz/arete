# Arete Project - Active Context

## Project Overview

**Arete** is a Graph-RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) AI tutoring system for classical philosophical texts. Combines Neo4j knowledge graphs, Weaviate vector embeddings, and multi-provider LLM support for accurate, well-cited philosophical education.

## Current Status - Phase 5.4 Complete âœ…

### ðŸŽŠ ACCESSIBILITY MILESTONE ACHIEVED: WCAG 2.1 AA COMPLIANCE OPERATIONAL

## System Architecture (Completed)

### Core Infrastructure âœ…
- **Phase 1**: Foundation complete (Database clients, models, configuration)
- **Phase 2**: Text processing complete (Chunking, PDF extraction, embeddings, citations)
- **Phase 3**: Retrieval systems complete (Sparse BM25/SPLADE, dense vectors, re-ranking)
- **Phase 4**: LLM integration complete (Multi-provider support, prompt engineering)
- **Phase 5**: User interface complete (Chat, document viewer, accessibility)

### Key Technical Decisions
- **TDD Methodology**: Contract-based testing, quality over quantity
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Neo4j + Weaviate + Redis for optimal performance  
- **Multi-Provider LLM**: User-controlled provider selection (Ollama, OpenRouter, Gemini, Anthropic, OpenAI)
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean data access separation across all components

## Next Priority: Data Ingestion and Content Expansion

### Classical Text Corpus Integration - IMMEDIATE NEXT PHASE
1. **Content Processing Pipeline**
   - Ingest complete works: Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas
   - Process PDFs and TEI-XML philosophical texts into knowledge graph
   - Build comprehensive citation networks and concept relationships

2. **Knowledge Graph Population**
   - Neo4j entity and relationship creation from classical texts
   - Weaviate vector indexing for semantic search
   - Citation validation and scholarly attribution system

3. **Production Content Readiness**
   - Full scholarly attribution for tutoring responses
   - Comprehensive philosophical concept mapping
   - Multi-language classical text support

## Memory System

**Hybrid Memory Architecture**: `.memory/` directory with categorized knowledge storage
- **Architecture**: Technical decisions, patterns, database schemas
- **Development**: Workflows, learnings, bug patterns, TDD methodology  
- **Archived**: Historical context and superseded implementations
- **Index**: Complete catalog with MemoryIDs and cross-references

## Core Development Principles

- **Test-Driven Development**: Strict Red-Green-Refactor cycle, >90% coverage
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Contract-based testing, focus on essential functionality
- **Don't Simplify to Pass**: *Never* simplify, hard-code, or patch tests to make them pass; fix the underlying code so the real-world behavior is correct.
- **Educational Focus**: Pedagogical value prioritized, all responses citation-backed
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type hints and Pydantic validation
- **Performance**: Connection pooling, caching, batch processing optimization

## Development Routines

- **start-day**: Read project context (CLAUDE.md, README.md, planning/, .memory/) and summarize current status
- **end-day**: Update project documentation and commit changes
